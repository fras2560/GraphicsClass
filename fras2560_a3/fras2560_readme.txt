Comments: if you have any. It took a long time to figure out why my cube was getting messed up when rotating
I noticed my normals were off on either apporaches (calculating or updating) so upon furth investigation I noticed my 
multiply_vector had some mistakes after fixing that everything worked well. That is why I spent
15 hours on this assignment.
