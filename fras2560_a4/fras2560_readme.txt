Comments: if you have any. My frame does not display until a after a click event for some reason, 
could not find out why. The Bezier Curve is really fun to play with and can make some cool 
objects when you rotate it 360. For the add objects and deleting them I used a linked
list and add functions to add/delete objects. I did not test remove_object
